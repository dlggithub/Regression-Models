# Regression-Models
The following project reviews a dataset from Motor Trend magazine, which consists of a collection of cars with either 
automatic transmissions or manual transmissions.  The data will be explored to answer two very interesting and necessary questions.  
The first question is whether an automatic or a manual transmission is best for MPG (miles per gallon).  
The second question is how different is the MPG between automatic and manual transmissions.
Codes from mtcars are as follows:
A data frame with 32 observations on 11 variables.	
mpg	Miles/(US) gallon		
cyl	Number of cylinders		
disp	Displacement (cu.in.)		
hp	Gross horsepower		
drat	Rear axle ratio		
wt	Weight (lb/1000)		
qsec	1/4 mile time		
vs	V/S			
am	Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)
gear	Number of forward gears		
carb	Number of carburetors		
				
This will be accomplished by exploratory data analysis.
